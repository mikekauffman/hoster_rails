HOSTER
======

This app was created by Mike Kauffman. The app is to be used by hosts at a restaurant to manage their waiting list efficiently. When a party arrives, the host enters their name, size, cell phone number, and the estimated wait time given to the party on arrival. When it's time for them to be seated, the host clicks 'Text Party' and they receive a text saying their table is ready. When a party is seated, the host will click 'Remove' and that party no longer displays on the waiting list. All relevant waiting time stats are tracked and displayed on the Stats page. A link to that page can be found at the bottom right of the page.
